It's built in Python using webapp2 framework and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template engine. Most of the styling is done using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). I couldn't have built this without awesome courses at [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/). I was greatly inspired by @ecmendenhall's [DaveDaveFind](http://davedavefind.appspot.com/). Big thanks to [Ash](http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/) for the transcripts. If you want to build something like this, I would suggest taking [CS 101](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012) & [CS 253](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs253/CourseRev/apr2012).","google":""}
